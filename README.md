# Meng_Project
This is all of the code for Meng project. 
The project is to develop a LSTM classifier to identify Denial of service(Dos) attack on a SCADA software testbed

*******************************************************************************************************************
The RNN.py can process the raw data from the testbed and make a LSTM classification. When using the RNN.py you need to 
change the location of training dataset and the test dataset. 

The dostraffic.sh is for generating normal and dos attack traffic.
